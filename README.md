## 🚀 Features

- **📱 Mobile Friendly** - Responsive design works on all devices
- **🔌 No Plugins** - Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **🎯 Accurate** - Based on Cornell's authoritative copyright chart
- **🔒 Private** - No data collection or tracking
- **♿ Accessible** - WCAG compliant for screen readers
- **📖 Open Source** - Free to use, modify, and embed

## 🎯 What It Does

This calculator helps you determine when creative works lose copyright protection and enter the public domain under US law. Simply answer a few questions about your work:

1. Type of work (published, unpublished, sound recording, etc.)
2. Year of publication or creation
3. Copyright notice status (for older works)
4. Renewal status (for works from 1923-1963)

The calculator will tell you:
- ✅ If the work is already in the public domain
- 📅 When it will enter the public domain
- ⚠️ Special conditions that may apply
